# Elevator Challenge

Your task is to create a console application in C# using OOP Principles that simulates the movement of elevators, with the goal being to move people as efficiently as possible.

The console application should provide the following features:
- show the status of the elevators, including which floor they are on, whether they are moving and in which direction, and how many people they are carrying
- provides a way to interact with the elevators, including calling them to a specific floor and setting the number of people waiting on each floor

The console application should be able to offer the following:
- support for multiple floors
- support for multiple elevators

## Hints

Given a pool of elevators, the program should send the nearest available elevator to that person.

## Extra Credit

For extra credit, allow a weight limit, expressed as a number of people, to be imposed on the elevators. You can assume every elevator in the simulation has the same weight limit.


# Possible improvements

- [ ] Multithreading
- [ ] Implementing the allowed limit feature
- [ ] Add more tests
